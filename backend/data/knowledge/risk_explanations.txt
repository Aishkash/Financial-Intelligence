Rapid Transaction Frequency:
Multiple transactions in a short time window can indicate automated fraud,
account takeover, or scripted attacks rather than normal human behavior.

Unusual Transaction Timing:
Transactions occurring at times when the user is historically inactive
may suggest compromised credentials or unauthorized access.

High Amount Deviation:
Transactions that significantly exceed a user’s typical spending amount
can indicate fraud, especially when combined with other anomalies.

New Device Usage:
When a transaction is initiated from a device not previously associated
with the user, it may suggest account takeover or device spoofing.

New Geographic Location:
Transactions originating from a new country or region shortly after another
location may indicate credential theft or proxy-based attacks.
